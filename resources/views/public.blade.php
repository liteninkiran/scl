                    <p><strong>Repairs</strong> are often overlooked when companies are budgeting to have their test equipment calibrated. For many reasons, most equipment will require repair at some stage, normally at a most inconvenient time. To reduce down-time and subsequent loss in production, <span>SCL</span> have a team of highly skilled engineers who are experienced in fault finding to component level on any test equipment, from AVO meters to complex Spectrum Analysers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Confidence</strong> in our ability in this field is supported by AVO / Megger Group Limited.

                    <p>This website does not contain glossy pictures of Nuclear Submarines or Space Stations, but simply factual information. Most companies appreciate the possible repercussion costs of not having instrumentation calibrated. It is vital therefore that the cost of calibration - an expense with no perceived return - is not simply paying for a Certificate of Calibration. We at <span>Southern Calibration Laboratories</span> believe that quality is <i>paramount</i> and that the time taken to read the following could well save you a lot of time and money in the future:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We hold <a href="https://www.ukas.com/wp-content/uploads/schedule_uploads/00001/0080Calibration-Multiple.pdf" target="_blank">UKAS Certification</a>, giving you piece of mind about our high standards</li>
                        <!-- <li>Full test results, instruments used and uncertainties are all provided as standard</li> -->
                        <li>We provide the following as standard:</li>

                            <li>Detailed test results</li>
                            <li>Instruments used</li>
                            <li>Uncertainties</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>We test the <strong>full range</strong> of a unit's measuring capabilities, recording exact results to the unit's <strong>maximum resolution</strong></li>
                        <li>Calibration measurements are routinely audited in accordance with internal policies</li>
